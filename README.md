# Day 1
# Data Science
Today, I started working on a Data Science project using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. Initially, I worked on the project and completed the pie chart visualization for gender distribution. However, I realized I had forgotten to implement OOP. So, I began refactoring my code to use classes and objects
