# Data Science
Today, I started working on a Data Science project using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. Initially, I worked on the project and completed the pie chart visualization for gender distribution. However, I realized I had forgotten to implement OOP. So, I began refactoring my code to use classes and objects

# Day 2
I have yet to complete tasks 5j and 5k. Once I finish them, I will commit. I also need to convert the .ipynb file to a .py file, and the documentation is still pending."
